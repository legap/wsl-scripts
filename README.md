# WSL installation scripts for debian/ubuntu

This repository provides some simple installation scripts for common development tools.
The main purpose is an easy and repeatable installation and update process.

To install a tool the following strategy is used:
- use an already available and maintained apt-source
- if no apt source available try to use the proposed installer
- when none of the above available use a custom script (i.e. maven for the current version)
